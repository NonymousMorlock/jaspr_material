# 0.2.0

### ðŸ’¥ Breaking
- **Renamed** the `colour` property to `color` for consistency with Dart and Flutter conventions.

### âœ¨ Features / Improvements
- Refactored `Icon` to extend `StatelessComponent` and reimplemented the rendering logic using `build()` for improved clarity and future compatibility.
- Simplified and modernised style composition using `Styles.combine` with built-in `color`, `fontSize`, and `lineHeight` support.
- Enhanced API consistency and improved internal code readability.
- Updated the example to reflect new API usage and Jaspr 0.21+ conventions.

### ðŸ§± Maintenance
- Upgraded SDK constraint to `>=3.8.0 <4.0.0`.
- Upgraded dependencies:
    - `jaspr` â†’ `>=0.21.6 <0.22.0`
    - `very_good_analysis` â†’ `>=6.0.0 <11.0.0`
- Minor documentation and README improvements for clarity and correctness.
